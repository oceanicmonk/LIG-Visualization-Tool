# LIG Visualization Tool

A Streamlit application to explore Logarithmic Intrinsic Geometry (LIG), a novel non-spatial geometry based on logarithmic operations. Features include log-points, log-structures (polygons, cycles, surfaces, volumes), transformations, and q-logarithms, with free (50 trials/month) and premium ($5/month) tiers.

## Features
- **Free Tier**: 2D visualizations of log-polygons and log-cycles, 50 trials/month.
- **Premium Tier**: 3D visualizations, transformations, animations, q-logarithms, reports.
- **Applications**: Computational geometry, information theory, cryptography, education.
- **Payments**: Razorpay for RBI-compliant subscriptions.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LIG-Visualization-Tool.git
   cd LIG-Visualization-Tool
