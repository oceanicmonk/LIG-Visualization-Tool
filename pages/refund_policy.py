Thank you for using the LIG Visualization Tool at [https://oceanicmonk-lig-visualization-tool-app-bxe29c.streamlit.app/](https://oceanicmonk-lig-visualization-tool-app-bxe29c.streamlit.app/). This Refund Policy outlines the conditions under which refunds are available for our Premium subscription.

### 1. Subscription Overview

### 2. Refund Eligibility
- **7-Day Money-Back Guarantee**: You may request a full refund within 7 days of your initial subscription purchase if you are dissatisfied with the Service.
- **Non-Delivery**: Refunds are issued if the Service is unavailable due to our fault (e.g., server downtime) for more than 24 hours.
- **Technical Issues**: If you experience persistent technical issues that we cannot resolve within 5 business days, you may request a refund.
